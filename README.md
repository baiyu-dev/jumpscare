# JUMPSCARE
A DungeonScript game made for YuriJam18

I made this game in order to test what was possible in DungeonScript. Working within its limitations was difficult but rewarding,
and I hope that by providing the source code for it, other interested developers will be able to create their own unique
DungeonScript games.

JUMPSCARE uses noteworthy functions such as:
- view_distance
- fog_power
- realtime_interval
- randomDir

JUMPSCARE.html can be downloaded to play the game offline, while jumpscare_source.txt contains the raw code that goes into the
DungeonScript editor.

You can use the DungeonScript editor here: http://dungeonscript.farbs.org

DungeonScript is based off of PuzzleScript: https://www.puzzlescript.net
